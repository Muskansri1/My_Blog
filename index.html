        <p class="flow-text">My name is Muskan Srivastava and I am a 4th year engineering student in Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra studying Computer Science and Engineering.

      3 years of college and studying around 50 plus subjects, I have realized that life always throws choices at you. It's now on you to decide, whether you regret your choices or do something good with them.<br>

       Procrastinator at heart, I love to travel, be on stage, act, read novels, listen to music and attempt to sing. From a homesick girl in first year to a responsible and independent adult, my journey has been quite 

exhilarating.

I am not a sex object, <br>

Neither am I a loaf of bread,<br>

Nor I am fragile like a flower,<br>

And<br>

Surely I was not deserved to be raped.<br>

It's my choice of living,<br>

Who are you to tell me what should I do,<br>

My clothes, my friends, my time, my needs.<br>

Why do I need to be protected from such cruel bastards?<br>

Why can't there be a place where i need not to be protected.<br>

And why are these monsters not supposed to die?<br>

Why was I the one who died?<br>

I, the one who suffered!<br>

I, the one who wept, cried and faced.<br>

Why should I face?<br>

What have I done?<br>

Was I an object whom you used for your enjoyment and excitement?<br>

Was I a tissue that you threw me on the chilly road naked?<br>

I was a human.<br>

A human who was once happy, sad, laughing, struggling and most of all,alive!<br>

There was a hope, after I died,<br>

That people might change<br>

But years after, all I got was a tight slap on my face.<br>

Because I forgot, that Rape is a girl's fault.<br>

So yes, It was my fault.<br>

It was my fault that I was born as a girl.<br>

It was my fault that I thought I might illuminate someone's life.<br>

It was my fault that i thought I was a human,<br>

Because I forgot, that I was just<br>

A loaf of bread for dog's to attack,<br>

A fragile flower to be plucked,<br>

And a sex object for sick monsters like you.<br>

Yes, It was my fault.<br>

            All i am asking you is to trust me,<br>
Trust me enough to let me fall,<br>
Trust me enough to let me stand back on my toes.<br>
I will make mistakes, we both are aware of that<br>
But trust me enough to rectify them myself <br>
Trust me enough to not stop me before i do anything stupid.<br>
Can you do that for me?<br>

All i am asking you is to trust me<br>
Trust me enough to let me go<br>
Trust me enough to wait for my return<br>
I wamt to be free from the things that cage me<br>
We know that i might get lost<br>
But trust me enough that i will find my own way back<br>
Can you do that for me?<br>

All i am asking you is to trust this trust<br>
The trust that i have for you<br>
The trust that binds us close<br>
There would be a lot of ups and downs<br> 
We know we might fall apart<br>
But trust our trust enough that we will build ourselves back<br> 
Can you do that for me?<br>

            The game of hide and seek, the unlimited laughing riot<br>
The book store visits,  the spicy young gossip<br>
Some memories I wish I could clone<br>
Walking on the streets alone<br>

All the love, the warmth she spread<br> 
On that brown whole wheat bread <br>
She was not just a mom,  but a friend of mine<br>
But oh! By the looks, she looked just so fine<br>

Leaving her was such a dreadful task<br>
That pretentiously excited mask which couldn't even last<br>
She knew all of me, hiding from her was never my cup of tea<br>
Whether it was a game of hide and seek<br>
Or it was my broken heart<br>
She knew she could handle it with some long drive, coffee and a filled shopping cart<br>

Late night studies, to heart felt 2 a.m. conversations<br>
Umm, well she was never by my side, 'cause she needed her beauty relaxation<br>
You see she was not a night person<br>
But oh! Rise and shine that beautiful face<br>
Ever so young and joyful face<br>
The mornings that she loved the most<br>
Where have those days gone lost? <br>
Just some memories I wish I could clone<br>
Walking on these streets alone<br>
